# Chapter 12 - Contrast, color, and spacing

# Contrast is king
- Contrast in design is a means of drawing attention to something by making it stand
  out. Our eyes and our minds naturally find patterns. When something breaks a
  pattern, our attention goes right to it. For contrast to work, the page must
  establish patterns; you cannot have an exception to the rule unless you first have
  a rule.
- Using modules that are shared by multiple elements on the page helps to establish
  the patterns with which to contrast.
- Contrast can be created using color, spacing, or size. If several items are light,
  but one is dark, you'll notice the dark item first. When one item is surrounded by
  a lot of unused space, it stands out. Large elements also stand out amid a series
  of smaller ones. Combining one of more of these effects can amplify the contrast.
- Often pages will have a Call to Action (CTA) element, which is the key element you
  want the user to interact with and draws their attention by having the greatest
  contrast to its surroundings.
- Sections of the page like the footer, will often feature the lowest contrast
  between text and the background on the page, so it doesn't draw the user's
  attention away from the other sections of the page.

# Color
- The color palette for a page will typically have one primary color that everything
  else is based on. It is often derived from the corporate branding or logo.
- The colors of the palette will often be varying shades of the same hue, or
  complementary colors to it.
- There will also probably be a black, a white, and a handful of grays defined in
  the palette. Due considerations of eye strain, the black and white will often be
  shades of gray in order to reduce the contrast a little.
- Assigning these colors to variables will allow them to be easily reused and
  changed should the design change down the line.
- With hexadecimal and rgb notation it can be hard to picture the colours being
  defined, or adjust them. HSL notation which uses hue, saturation, and luminosity
  values can often be better; it's easier to guess the color from the definition and
  also to choose colors with the same or complementing hues that will work well
  together in a palette.
- The hsl() function takes three values. The first value, representing hue, is an
  integer between 0 and 359. This indicates the 360 degrees around the color circle,
  transitioning evenly through red (0), yellow (60), green (120), cyan (180), blue
  (240), magenta (300), and back to red. The second value, representing saturation,
  is a percentage defining the intensity of the color: 100% makes the color vivid,
  and 0% means no color is present, resulting in a shade of gray. The third value,
  representing lightness, is a percentage defining how light (or dark) the color is.
  A lightness of 50% provides for the most vivid colors - setting it higher makes
  the color lighter, with 100% resulting in pure white; setting it lower makes the
  color darker, with 0% resulting in black. e.g. hsl(198, 73%, 46%);
- To find a color's complement you can simply add (or subtract) 180 to (or from) the
  hue value. e.g the complement of 162 is 342 (or -18).
- If there is insufficient contrast between colors they can be difficult to read.
  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide provide a minimum
  recommended contrast ratio (called level AA) and a stricter, enhanced contrast
  ratio (called level AAA). To account for the difference in legibility of larger
  and regular sized text, both levels provide different ratios for the two text
  sizes, the larger size having a smaller ratio.
